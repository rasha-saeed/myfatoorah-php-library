------------------------------
## [2.2.11] - 2026-11-16
### Added
- Stop the self-update with a `.mf-env` file. Create it next to `autoload.php` holding the word `development`, and the library stops downloading new versions. With no such file - the normal case - the update runs as before.

### Changed
- Make the library safe on PHP 8.5, which is what this release is for: every `curl_close()` call (deprecated since 8.5, without effect since 8.0) now releases the handle instead, in the library and in the loader that ships with the manual install, and the non-canonical `(double)` cast is replaced by `(float)`.
- Supported PHP versions are unchanged: the library still installs on PHP 7.0 and up.
- Relicense from GPL-3.0-only to the MIT License, so any PHP developer can take the code, change it and ship it inside their own product. Its one condition is keeping the copyright notice.
- Report a failed self-update or configuration update to the server error log instead of raising a PHP warning, and name the cause where the library cannot go on.
- Correct the wording of the `Worng event.` exception thrown by `MyFatoorahWebhook`; it now reads `Wrong event.`. A caller matching on the old text must be updated.
- Rename the `$KeyType` parameter of `getPaymentStatus()` to `$keyType`, matching `refund()` and the rest of the library. It only affects callers that pass it as a named argument.

### Fixed
- Harden the two downloads the library makes on its own: its own update from the portal, and the countries configuration behind `mf-config.json`. Neither now overwrites what is installed unless the portal really answered with it; both carry a connect timeout of 3 seconds and a transfer timeout of 6; and a failed download no longer repeats on every page view. Where any of these went wrong, a merchant met a broken page, a slow checkout page, or a damaged configuration.

### Security
- Pass explicit flags to `htmlspecialchars()` in `MyFatoorahHelper::filterInputField()`. The default flags changed in PHP 8.1, so on PHP 8.0 and older single quotes were left unescaped and a filtered value could break out of a single-quoted HTML attribute.

------------------------------
## [2.1.5] - 2026-11-16
### Added
- Add `executePayment()`, correctly spelled.
- Stop the self-update with a `.mf-env` file. Create it next to `autoload.php` holding the word `development`, and the library stops downloading new versions. With no such file - the normal case - the update runs as before.

### Changed
- Make the library safe on PHP 8.5, which is what this release is for: every `curl_close()` call (deprecated since 8.5, without effect since 8.0) now releases the handle instead, in the library and in the loader that ships with the manual install, and the non-canonical `(double)` cast is replaced by `(float)`.
- Supported PHP versions are unchanged: the library still installs on PHP 7.0 and up.
- Relicense from GPL-3.0-only to the MIT License, so any PHP developer can take the code, change it and ship it inside their own product. Its one condition is keeping the copyright notice.
- Report a failed self-update or configuration update to the server error log instead of raising a PHP warning, and name the cause where the library cannot go on.
- Reformat the source to PSR-12. A merchant who patched the library by hand will see a large diff.
- Rename the misspelled `$currncy` parameter of `getPaymentStatus()` to `$currency`, and its `$KeyType` parameter to `$keyType`, matching the rest of the library. Both only affect callers that pass them as named arguments.
- Correct the wording of the `Phone Number lenght` exception thrown by `getPhone()`; it now reads `length`, matching the 2.2 branch. A caller matching on the old text must be updated.

### Deprecated
- `excutePayment()` is kept as a wrapper that forwards to `executePayment()`, so existing callers are unaffected. A subclass that **overrides** `excutePayment()` is no longer reached and should override `executePayment()` instead.

### Fixed
- Judge an invoice expired in the vendor's own time zone instead of Kuwait's. `getErrorData()` read the expiry date the API returns - which is in the vendor's local time - as if it were Kuwait time, so a merchant in Cairo saw an invoice marked `Expired` a full hour before it was, and a merchant in Dubai saw one stay `Pending` an hour after it had expired. Riyadh, Doha and Kuwait City share Kuwait's offset and were never affected. The zone now comes from the country configuration, falling back to Kuwait where the country code is one the library does not know.
- Harden the two downloads the library makes on its own: its own update from the portal, and the countries configuration behind `mf-config.json`. Neither now overwrites what is installed unless the portal really answered with it; both carry a connect timeout of 3 seconds and a transfer timeout of 6; a failed download no longer repeats on every page view; and a missing `mf-config.json` is created again instead of leaving a merchant outside Kuwait on the Kuwait API URL for good. Where any of these went wrong, a merchant met a broken page, a slow checkout page, or the wrong API URL.
- Correct the `Excute Payment` label written to the log file; it now reads `Execute Payment`, matching the 2.2 branch.
